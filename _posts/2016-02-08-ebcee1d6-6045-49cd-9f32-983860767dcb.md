Marlon Lynn Architect, P.A. is an architectural firm
located in Lakeland, Florida, strategically positioned to
serve clients throughout the state. With over 60 years of
combined architectural experience in all building and
construction types, we are well-equipped to undertake a
wide spectrum of project types and sizes.

Marlon Lynn Architect, P.A. is proud to offer hands-on
project management with personal attention to your
project. Unlike many larger corporate firms, your work
matters to us and will be overseen by the same team
throughout the process. In addition, we provide you the
assurance that you can return to the same Design
Professionals months, even years later, and know we will
address any questions you may have. Our comprehensive
knowledge and understanding of your project is an
enduring resource you can count on when you partner
with our firm.

Over the past ten years we have designed over 650
projects for business owners, investors, contractors and
developers. These include new construction as well as
redesign and remodel of existing structures. Many of our
clients have called on us for multiple projects because
they know our experience allows us to match design
solutions to their project budget. In addition, we
understand the importance of reduced design schedules,
and have the experience and relationships to work with
local building departments to permit quickly.
